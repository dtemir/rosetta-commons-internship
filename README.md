# Summer 2021 RosettaCommons Internship (Stanford Lab)

## Preparation

Prior to the bootcamp, we were assigned homework to set up PyRosetta and learn Python.

In [homework #1](preparation/01_00_How_to_Get_Started.ipynb), we install PyRosetta on our Google Colab Environments. It required some internal tweaking and a separate .whl from the developer. In its [continuation](01_02_PyRosetta_Google_Drive_Usage_Example.ipynb), we check if everything works.

We then do [homework #2](preparation/homework_2.py) on Python for-loops, [homework #3](preparation/homework_3.ipynb) on if-else statements, and [homework #4](preparation/homework_4.ipynb) on functions.

    To make everything work in Google Colab, I ended up having a PyRosetta directory with the .whl file in my Google Drive home directory MyDrive. Also, I kept the inputs, Media, and Sessions directories in a directory named temp_pyrbc_202103_notebooks.
